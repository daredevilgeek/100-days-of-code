# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Preparing for my 100 days! Learned more about GitHub including basics like how to fork repositories. Getting reinvolved in the Code Camp forums and finding resources. Also spent some time learning how to customise Powershell.

**Thoughts:** This 100 days of code will be a good way to get momentum back - I enjoy learning but struggle to keep going when life gets busy. My 'profile project' from a couple of months ago (linked below) shows how easily I give up.
