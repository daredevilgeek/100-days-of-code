# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# This is the log I'll use for the second attempt of 100-days-of-code. 
# My longterm goals are simple and malleable: learn enough to comfortably become a digital nomad. Make my app. Be able to comfortably do the Codewars Kata without looking at hints. Become a confident problemsolver with code.

### Day 1: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've prepared my github and got my rules straight. I'm going to do this, and this time I'll be more accountable and make it the full 100 days - and make a proper lifestyle habit. 

**Thoughts:** No more Facebook scrolling to fill in my evenings, I've got work to do. This month is perfect to bring in new habits as I'm already initiating new behaviours - Junk Free June and training for a race in August. NO MORE EXCUSES.
