# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# This is the log I'll use for the second attempt of 100-days-of-code. 
## My longterm goals are simple and malleable: learn enough to comfortably become a digital nomad. Make my app. Be able to comfortably do the Codewars Kata without looking at hints. Become a confident problemsolver with code.

### Day 4 June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some practical exercises with JavaScript Object Properties. Starting to get so complicated!

**Thoughts:** It's good to feel challenged. This is where the good work starts.

### Day 3: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent half my time studying the Stackskills, and then did some practical exercises through FCC which really challenged me.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the exercise (accessing nested arrays with JavaScript) but I felt a sense of achievement once I finished, though my solution was definitely less than elegant!

### Day 2: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied JavaScript through the Stackskills course and learned about hiding divs on button click, and sending messages to the console which was new information.

**Thoughts:** The videos I'm watching are a little slow, but I think it'll only take me another two days to get through this course and put the information into action (or into another more hands-on course). I might go back and forth between this and the FCC projects because I know those are really hands-on and tricky.

### Day 1: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've prepared my github and got my rules straight. I'm going to do this, and this time I'll be more accountable and make it the full 100 days - and make a proper lifestyle habit. I also spent some time working through StackSkills Javascript. The general rules for the 100days are not to use courses, but for me that's out of the question - this is to learn to code primarily, and then I can move into using those skills.

**Thoughts:** No more Facebook scrolling to fill in my evenings, I've got work to do. This month is perfect to bring in new habits as I'm already initiating new behaviours - Junk Free June and training for a race in August. NO MORE EXCUSES. I'm happy to be here again.
