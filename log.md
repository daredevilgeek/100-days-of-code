# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# This is the log I'll use for the second attempt of 100-days-of-code. 
## My longterm goals are simple and malleable: learn enough to comfortably become a digital nomad. Make my app. Be able to comfortably do the Codewars Kata without looking at hints. Become a confident problemsolver with code.


## R1D48: Nov 4 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a new website for myself to get ready for when I'm freelancing. I have been working on it for a few days but today was the only day that really met the #100daysofcode criteria!

**Thoughts:** Feeling good! Should get back to the JavaScript 30.

## R1D47: Oct 25 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the CSS Variables challenge on the JavaScript30. Realised I'd skipped the first one so need to go back and finish that.

**Thoughts:** Accomplished something.

## R1D46: Oct 24 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first of the JavaScript30 Challenges - the clock. Quite like the format of the learning, it's a good pace and I can keep pausing and creeping through the video to see all the code.

**Thoughts:** Accomplished something.

## R1D45: Oct 20 2017

**Today's Progress**: I wrote four articles for the FCC Guide - four pull requests for Hacktoberfest. Super exciting way to get involved, and now I've seen all the content that's available in the guide I"m looking forward to reading all the rest of it.

**Thoughts:** Had a burst of motivation over that - great initiative.

## R1D42-44: Oct 17 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through the bootcamp, enjoying the challenges and also the pace.

**Thoughts:** Losing track a little bit, not really prioritising this but still learning every day.

## R1D39-41: Oct 7,8, 10 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through the fullstack bootcamp, and doing some custom scripting for work. 

**Thoughts:** Feeling good, looking ahead to my future and planning for where I want to be.

## R1D38: Oct 4 2017

**Today's Progress**: Starting a fullstack bootcamp - I've got 6 months left before I have to fend for myself so need to upskill!

**Thoughts:** This bootcamp looks good. I need to reassess my priorities and get really serious about it all.

## R1D37: Oct 3 2017

**Today's Progress**: I got a reply from my API! I can now see the weather (in my console) based on my location! Next step is to build a visual design based on this.

**Thoughts:** Yay!

## R1D35-36: Oct 1-2 2017

**Today's Progress**: Okay, so I took a break. I was frustrated with not knowing how to solve the weather project and couldn't get past the roadblock. There's been a lot happening (I quit my job). I finally sucked it up and took the opportunity yesterday to go to an FCC meetup. While it wasn't overly helpful code-wise, it gave me a little push so I'm back into it today.

**Thoughts:** I'll get there.

## R1D34: Sept 13 2017

**Today's Progress**: Going through the callback classes on TeamTreehouse. I'm not sure I get it yet but I'm definitely in a better spot to look at my weather project. I'll keep learning and checking back with it.

**Thoughts:** Inspired.

## R1D33: Sept 13 2017

**Today's Progress**: Decided not to look at other projects, but to focus on courses for AJAX, APIs, callbacks, and jQuery to be able to fully understand and solve the problem myself. Finished a geolocation API session on TeamTreehouse and will move onto callbacks tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Determined!!

## R1D31: Sept 10 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just a bit too stumped.

**Thoughts:** It might be time to look at other projects to see how they did it.

## R1D30: Sept 10 2017

**Today's Progress**: Might be getting somewhere with the weather app after a combination of a couple of hints I had - one from Twitter and one given to someone else with a different error. Will follow up tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** Am adopting better commenting practices in my code, and also using Pomodoro timers for my work to try and promote deep focus.

## R1D28-29: Sept 8-9 2017

**Today's Progress**: Getting frustrated with my Weather Project. The APIs are both working fine but I can't get the variables to return values outside of their given functions so it's not all playing together properly. I've posted it on Twitter asking it for feedback.

**Thoughts:** Maybe I'll look at something else for a bit and come back with a fresh mind.

## R1D27: Sept 7 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some fair progress with the geolocation but having some issues with the jQuery variables not returning / storing what I'm expecting, so I'm developing my troubleshooting skills and will have another look at my jQuery resources to see if there's anything I've missed.

**Thoughts:** I'll get there - the goal is in sight :)

## R1D26: Sept 5 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got some sweet responses coming from the weather API on my FCC project, and can even reference each object (hurrah!). Now moving on to getting the geolocation working before I nail down the weather responses better. It's still outputting a completely blank page and a whole lot of stuff to the console, but hey, it works for me!

**Thoughts:** Improvements are small but steady.

## R1D25: Sept 4 2017

**Today's Progress**: Had another go at cleaning up the API on my weather project. Renewed my interest in my website, and put up a post. Now going back through JSON API doco trying to figure it out!

**Thoughts:** Keeping calm and level headed with techniques I've been learning lately.

## R1D23-24: Sept 2-3 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started my Weather project. Having a problem with parsing the XML response so will most likely rewrite as JSON - I think this will be a better lesson for me anyway.

**Thoughts:** Trying to get more scheduled and structured - sit down at the computer and take 5 min to decide what to focus on this session - rather than stabbing around on the internet. Story of my life, right? 

## R1D22: Aug 30 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my brother's website and handed it over to him, and finished my Random Quote Machine and submitted it! Even got the Twitter bit going. What a day!

**Thoughts:** I'm only going to get better by doing real stuff, not the bit-by-bit lessons that I love. I offered to do a website for my gym, since theirs has expired. 

## R1D21: Aug 29 2017

**Today's Progress**: Random Quote Machine is working and looking good! However, when I went to submit, I found that the user story about Twitter wasn't optional - I'm now working on getting that going and it's proving far harder than I thought it'd be.

**Thoughts:** Enjoying the playfulness and experimentation of trying to solve a problem.


## R1D20: Aug 28 2017

**Today's Progress**: Back into it. Reviewing my Bootstrap learning and using the information to clean up my Random Quote Machine. Should be ready to submit very soon!

**Thoughts:** Had a brief existential crisis about what I should be studying. Realised there's not much point in studying web dev when that's not what I want to do (I'm shite at design). I had decided to drop it all and go back to Python/Arduino/code that makes stuff happen! However, I looked at the map in FCC and saw that it actually follows a trajectory I'd like to be on, so I'm sticking with it for now.

## R1D18-19: Aug 18-19 2017

**Today's Progress**: Bit of Responsive Design and also Javascript Full Stack study on Treehouse.

**Thoughts:** Super hard to get inspired to study at the moment - work stress is getting in the way so I'm trying to go easy on myself :)

## R1D17: Aug 17 2017

**Today's Progress**: Bit of cleanup on the website, and then a bit of Responsive Design with Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** Sleepy!

## R1D15: Aug 15 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got my random quote machine spitting out random quotes on demand. Victory! Now to make it look pretty. I'm going back to brush up on my responsive design (it's all gone from my head). I also whipped up a simple (but elegant) Wordpress site for my brother.

**Thoughts:** Feeling... accomplished.

## R1D14: Aug 14 2017

**Today's Progress**: I GOT A FECKIN QUOTE ON A PAGE!! It just keeps spitting out the same one, but it's huge, after 5 weeks... I'll take it! Now I just have to clean it up, and get it spitting out new ones.

**Thoughts:** On top of the world.

## R1D13: Aug 13 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my jQuery study, and went back to project work. Figured out one of the many issues with my Random Quote Machine - I'd been trying for two weeks to use an xml query on a JSON API... sigh.

**Thoughts:** I've found some great resources but I'm being careful on how I use them - if I take information from them I want to be sure I understand it all to come up with it again after using it. No copy/paste cheats!

## R1D11-12: Aug 11-12 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent all day today studying jQuery. Feel like I'm getting a real grip on it thanks to Codecademy - they don't spoonfeed anything.

**Thoughts:** Great fun - my non-work days (when I'm not out of town) are now spent sitting at the table coding all day. Bliss.

## R1D10: Aug 10 2017

**Today's Progress**: Focussing on JQuery through Codecademy. I feel like I've learned this before but not paid enough attention. Now that I need it for a project, I have context to apply it to, and it's making a lot of sense.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. Evening routine is much easier with a dining table - couch is dangerously hard to code on.

## R1D9: Aug 9 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent a solid few hours today working on my Random Quote Generator. Have tried a couple of different APIs and now realised my JQuery knowledge is sub-par (was using JavaScript) so am back to CodeCademy to brush up before finishing.

**Thoughts:** It was great to get a really good chunk of time dedicated to this, and now I know to go to CodeCademy for quick learning where I need to (initially dismissed that resource in favour of FCC because of keyboard shortcuts).

## R1D8: Aug 8 2017

**Today's Progress**: Dedicated my evening to it. Did some JavaScript lessons on loops, then some CodeWars, then finally some CodeCademy Command Line sessions.

**Thoughts:** Why is it so hard to get myself motivated and consistent with this?

## R1D5-7: July 30-Aug 1 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished JavaScript Basics and now onto Loops, Arrays, and Objects. This is all revision but is filling some good gaps. 

**Thoughts:** Clear and confident.

## R1D4: July 28 2017

**Today's Progress**: Getting into more lengthy apps with Treehouse. 

**Thoughts:** This seems more thorough and less spoonfed than FCC - The challenges make you think as it's not all written there to copy/paste.

## R1D3: July 27 2017

**Today's Progress**: Playing round with Javascript, building simple web apps.

**Thoughts:** Really enjoying Treehouse, and also have been listening to Frontier podcasts. 

## R1D2: July 25 2017

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript with Treehouse. prompt, alert, document.write.

**Thoughts:** Much more motivated.

## R1D1: July 24 2017

**Today's Progress**: Signed up with Team Treehouse. Step by step is my game, especially at this stage of knowledge.

**Thoughts:** Come on dude, you got this.

## Line in the sand - let's give this another go.

## Day 19: July 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 3 hours of podcasts (Javascript and Python) and 1 hour of learning AJAX protocols in preparation for the Random Quote Generator. 

**Thoughts:**  Self-directed learning (different to FCC step-by-step) is a skill to be learned - I'm working on it.

## Day 18: July 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Struggling with the Random Quote Generator. Learning about AJAX which is cool! 

**Thoughts:**  Finding other ways to engage with coding on days where I'm unwell or away from my computer (like this week) - have found a rich variety of podcasts to keep me excited.

## Day 17: July 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Going swimmingly on the API and JSON FCC, now at random quote generator and panicking!

**Thoughts:** Uhm, where do I start?

## Day 13-16: June 26-July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Algorithm challenges, battling through one by one :)

**Thoughts:** Having trouble with GitHub due to my account name change I think? Losing server connection after validating as an incorrect user so keep losing the day's progress.

## Day 12: June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I thought indexOf() was going to be easy but this algorithm challenge is tricky! I might mix up solving this with working on something else. Reading around hasn't helped so far.

**Thoughts:** Had a week off due to chaotic life but back online and onboard.

### Day 11: June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Was happily chugging through algorithm challenges and now hit a stinker! Can't get my head around sub arrays.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good about the time I set aside for this.

### Day 10: June 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Nailed a couple of algorithm challenges today with Javascript on FCC. 

**Thoughts:** I'm sure it hasn't been that long since I coded so maybe I forgot to log a day?? 

### Day 9: June 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Title Case algorithm challenges got me puzzled.

**Thoughts:** Feeling positive about maintaining this - skipped a day yesterday due to commitments but there's a lot that's motivating me.

### Day 8: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Aw yiss, nailed two algorithm challenges, palindromes and finding the longest word in a sentence.

**Thoughts:** I'm on top of the world!

### Day 7: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Stuck on an algorithm challenge, think it's the .replace() bit that's doing it. 

**Thoughts:** Struggling with this is oddly satisfying.

### Day 6: June 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I got to the algorithm challenges! I've completed two and working on a third. It's exciting.

**Thoughts:** I'm having to look things up but it feels like it'll stick better this way.

### Day 5: June 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spread out my time spent into bite-sized exercise chunks throughout the day. I worked through more JS using "this." and array functions.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed it.

### Day 4: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some practical exercises with JavaScript Object Properties. Starting to get so complicated!

**Thoughts:** It's good to feel challenged. This is where the good work starts.

### Day 3: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent half my time studying the Stackskills, and then did some practical exercises through FCC which really challenged me.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the exercise (accessing nested arrays with JavaScript) but I felt a sense of achievement once I finished, though my solution was definitely less than elegant!

### Day 2: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied JavaScript through the Stackskills course and learned about hiding divs on button click, and sending messages to the console which was new information.

**Thoughts:** The videos I'm watching are a little slow, but I think it'll only take me another two days to get through this course and put the information into action (or into another more hands-on course). I might go back and forth between this and the FCC projects because I know those are really hands-on and tricky.

### Day 1: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've prepared my github and got my rules straight. I'm going to do this, and this time I'll be more accountable and make it the full 100 days - and make a proper lifestyle habit. I also spent some time working through StackSkills Javascript. The general rules for the 100days are not to use courses, but for me that's out of the question - this is to learn to code primarily, and then I can move into using those skills.

**Thoughts:** No more Facebook scrolling to fill in my evenings, I've got work to do. This month is perfect to bring in new habits as I'm already initiating new behaviours - Junk Free June and training for a race in August. NO MORE EXCUSES. I'm happy to be here again.
