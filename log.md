# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# This is the log I'll use for the second attempt of 100-days-of-code. 
## My longterm goals are simple and malleable: learn enough to comfortably become a digital nomad. Make my app. Be able to comfortably do the Codewars Kata without looking at hints. Become a confident problemsolver with code.

## R1D9: Aug 9 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent a solid few hours today working on my Random Quote Generator. Have tried a couple of different APIs and now realised my JQuery knowledge is sub-par (was using JavaScript) so am back to CodeCademy to brush up before finishing.

**Thoughts:** It was great to get a really good chunk of time dedicated to this, and now I know to go to CodeCademy for quick learning where I need to (initially dismissed that resource in favour of FCC because of keyboard shortcuts).

## R1D8: Aug 8 2017

**Today's Progress**: Dedicated my evening to it. Did some JavaScript lessons on loops, then some CodeWars, then finally some CodeCademy Command Line sessions.

**Thoughts:** Why is it so hard to get myself motivated and consistent with this?

## R1D5-7: July 30-Aug 1 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished JavaScript Basics and now onto Loops, Arrays, and Objects. This is all revision but is filling some good gaps. 

**Thoughts:** Clear and confident.

## R1D4: July 28 2017

**Today's Progress**: Getting into more lengthy apps with Treehouse. 

**Thoughts:** This seems more thorough and less spoonfed than FCC - The challenges make you think as it's not all written there to copy/paste.

## R1D3: July 27 2017

**Today's Progress**: Playing round with Javascript, building simple web apps.

**Thoughts:** Really enjoying Treehouse, and also have been listening to Frontier podcasts. 

## R1D2: July 25 2017

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript with Treehouse. prompt, alert, document.write.

**Thoughts:** Much more motivated.

## R1D1: July 24 2017

**Today's Progress**: Signed up with Team Treehouse. Step by step is my game, especially at this stage of knowledge.

**Thoughts:** Come on dude, you got this.

## Line in the sand - let's give this another go.

## Day 19: July 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 3 hours of podcasts (Javascript and Python) and 1 hour of learning AJAX protocols in preparation for the Random Quote Generator. 

**Thoughts:**  Self-directed learning (different to FCC step-by-step) is a skill to be learned - I'm working on it.

## Day 18: July 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Struggling with the Random Quote Generator. Learning about AJAX which is cool! 

**Thoughts:**  Finding other ways to engage with coding on days where I'm unwell or away from my computer (like this week) - have found a rich variety of podcasts to keep me excited.

## Day 17: July 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Going swimmingly on the API and JSON FCC, now at random quote generator and panicking!

**Thoughts:** Uhm, where do I start?

## Day 13-16: June 26-July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Algorithm challenges, battling through one by one :)

**Thoughts:** Having trouble with GitHub due to my account name change I think? Losing server connection after validating as an incorrect user so keep losing the day's progress.

## Day 12: June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I thought indexOf() was going to be easy but this algorithm challenge is tricky! I might mix up solving this with working on something else. Reading around hasn't helped so far.

**Thoughts:** Had a week off due to chaotic life but back online and onboard.

### Day 11: June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Was happily chugging through algorithm challenges and now hit a stinker! Can't get my head around sub arrays.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good about the time I set aside for this.

### Day 10: June 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Nailed a couple of algorithm challenges today with Javascript on FCC. 

**Thoughts:** I'm sure it hasn't been that long since I coded so maybe I forgot to log a day?? 

### Day 9: June 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Title Case algorithm challenges got me puzzled.

**Thoughts:** Feeling positive about maintaining this - skipped a day yesterday due to commitments but there's a lot that's motivating me.

### Day 8: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Aw yiss, nailed two algorithm challenges, palindromes and finding the longest word in a sentence.

**Thoughts:** I'm on top of the world!

### Day 7: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Stuck on an algorithm challenge, think it's the .replace() bit that's doing it. 

**Thoughts:** Struggling with this is oddly satisfying.

### Day 6: June 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I got to the algorithm challenges! I've completed two and working on a third. It's exciting.

**Thoughts:** I'm having to look things up but it feels like it'll stick better this way.

### Day 5: June 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spread out my time spent into bite-sized exercise chunks throughout the day. I worked through more JS using "this." and array functions.

**Thoughts:** Enjoyed it.

### Day 4: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some practical exercises with JavaScript Object Properties. Starting to get so complicated!

**Thoughts:** It's good to feel challenged. This is where the good work starts.

### Day 3: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent half my time studying the Stackskills, and then did some practical exercises through FCC which really challenged me.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the exercise (accessing nested arrays with JavaScript) but I felt a sense of achievement once I finished, though my solution was definitely less than elegant!

### Day 2: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied JavaScript through the Stackskills course and learned about hiding divs on button click, and sending messages to the console which was new information.

**Thoughts:** The videos I'm watching are a little slow, but I think it'll only take me another two days to get through this course and put the information into action (or into another more hands-on course). I might go back and forth between this and the FCC projects because I know those are really hands-on and tricky.

### Day 1: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've prepared my github and got my rules straight. I'm going to do this, and this time I'll be more accountable and make it the full 100 days - and make a proper lifestyle habit. I also spent some time working through StackSkills Javascript. The general rules for the 100days are not to use courses, but for me that's out of the question - this is to learn to code primarily, and then I can move into using those skills.

**Thoughts:** No more Facebook scrolling to fill in my evenings, I've got work to do. This month is perfect to bring in new habits as I'm already initiating new behaviours - Junk Free June and training for a race in August. NO MORE EXCUSES. I'm happy to be here again.
