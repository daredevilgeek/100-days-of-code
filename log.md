# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Preparing for my 100 days! Learned more about GitHub including basics like how to fork repositories. Getting reinvolved in the Code Camp forums and finding resources. Also spent some time learning how to customise Powershell.

**Thoughts:** This 100 days of code will be a good way to get momentum back - I enjoy learning but struggle to keep going when life gets busy. My 'profile project' from a couple of months ago (linked below) shows how easily I give up.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started my Portfolio page (second FCC project in the training map). I've gone through a couple of other examples to look at the code they've used and see where to start.

**Thoughts:** It's been a couple of months since I touched the coding and oh gosh - this is harder than I thought. I think the hard part is starting - I know what to do when I've got code and I'm trying to troubleshoot or improve it, but writing it from scratch is far harder. I'm looking at other resources but typing whatever I take myself, as copy/paste won't help me learn. Perseverance is key - and that's why I stopped for so long - this project has definitely been a roadblock in the past. 100daysofcode will hopefully help me build a ladder over that!

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've started the Udemy course - The Complete Web Developer Masterclass. I've set up Notepad++ and started using Emmet. Abbreviations really appeal to me and I can see them being something I'll use a lot once I get the hang of it - I'm always building macros and shortcuts for my work so coding abbreviations will be handy.

**Thoughts:** Following courses is definitely a bit of a comfort zone for now - I might go 50/50 with following courses (Udemy and FCC) and Project work, as I can see the benefit of both, and the Udemy course has lots of exciting things further down the line like PHP and MySQL which I can use in day-to-day work. A better study environment will help, including a mouse and external monitor (working on it!) and I've also had support from work should I choose to study through the University for qualifications, so that's something to aim for - I'd like to get a bit more confidence before committing to that, and I'd like to know enough about what I enjoy to choose a specialty - this will come with experience.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I didn't have any internet so did a coding from scratch exercise to see what I could remember without any referencing materials. It'll be good to recreate this exercise in 3 months and compare.

**Thoughts:** The best way to learn is to figure it out myself - getting the answer easily by looking it up when I'm stuck doesn't cement it for next time.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did some further study with the Udemy course, and then installed Github Desktop to try and learn a sustainable way of working on projects.

**Thoughts:** I had a quick browse on the available courses on Udemy and got excited by the possibilities of what there is to learn - I need to dedicate more time.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did some further study with the Udemy course, following alongside with Notepad++. There was some new stuff with tables which was pretty cool and their resources are great - I'm saving them all for future reference.

**Thoughts:** I think I've got to get a few more of these study sessions under my belt before I go back to the FCC projects - I learn by doing but at the moment I don't have enough to work with so have to expand my knowledgebase. I have a dedicated study area now which is motivating me to spend more time studying and coding.
