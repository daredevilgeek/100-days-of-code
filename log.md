# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Preparing for my 100 days! Learned more about GitHub including basics like how to fork repositories. Getting reinvolved in the Code Camp forums and finding resources. Also spent some time learning how to customise Powershell.

**Thoughts:** This 100 days of code will be a good way to get momentum back - I enjoy learning but struggle to keep going when life gets busy. My 'profile project' from a couple of months ago (linked below) shows how easily I give up.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started my Portfolio page (second FCC project in the training map). I've gone through a couple of other examples to look at the code they've used and see where to start.

**Thoughts:** It's been a couple of months since I touched the coding and oh gosh - this is harder than I thought. I think the hard part is starting - I know what to do when I've got code and I'm trying to troubleshoot or improve it, but writing it from scratch is far harder. I'm looking at other resources but typing whatever I take myself, as copy/paste won't help me learn. Perserverence is key - and that's why I stopped for so long - this project has definitely been a roadblock in the past. 100daysofcode will hopefully help me build a ladder over that!
