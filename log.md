# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 27: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learning about the Unix Shell, building towards automation. Loved every minute of today's ResBaz sessions and worked through the material at home too, and will continue to work through it.

**Thoughts:** It's opened my eyes to new things, and got me super excited about coding again - I find automation/programming a lot more rewarding than design, which is what most of the FCC stuff has been so far (though that's been good to learn basics with). 

### Day 26: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC Javascript > Object Properties. Also installed the necessary software for my Software Carpentry sessions starting tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** The FCC challenges are starting to get a bit tricky which is really good, not so repetitive any more - and can't wait for my first Software workshop tomorrow -Automating Tasks with the Unix Shell, yay!

### Day 25: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FCC Javascript > Switch statements. 

**Thoughts:** Kind of hoping (but kind of dreading) that there's an FCC project sometime soon.

### Day 24: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Javascript - local and global variables. And signed up for Software Carpentry sessions next week!

**Thoughts:** Super super jump-up-and-down excited to learn about automation, Python, and Git version control next week!

### Day 23: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through C++ on Sololearn while waiting in the car.

**Thoughts:** Still stuck on pointers and allocating memory. The app doesn't apply it in real usage terms and I can't understand how to apply it or what it means!

### Day 22: January 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through FCC Javascript and also C++ on Sololearn while waiting in the car.

**Thoughts:** Is it just me or are pointers confusing af?

### Day 21: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through FCC Javascript.

**Thoughts:** I really like the bitesize way of working with FCC, the projects are good every now and then but there's something satisfying about tiny tasks.

### Day 20: January 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I FINALLY finished my Portfolio - fixed the display issues with the navigation bars and images, and deemed it fit for purpose - submitted it through FCC and am now moving on.

**Thoughts:** Portfolio's been a bit of a roadblock, so moving on from it will be good, the next section is Javascript which I really enjoy and should help me with CodeWars!

### Day 16-19: January 20-27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I spent these days studying C++ on Sololearn. 

**Thoughts:** Life's been getting in the way and I've been away from my computer, but the apps make it easy to study. I need to readjust my daily routine to prioritise.

### Day 15: January 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've finally sorted the issue with the things showing in the wrong order on my Portfolio! Wahey! Big wins. Now some formatting and to get some proper content in there before moving on to better things - to fill up my portfolio with!

**Thoughts:** Feeling good about it - got up early this morning and instead of going to the gym, worked on my projects.

### Day 14: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I accidentally overwrote some of yesterday's work and had to redo it, but this time I did it better so no problem! I've just seen the upcoming modules of the Udemy course are in structure of a web page which will be really helpful for my Portfolio - I'll get through those over the next couple of those, tidy up my Portfolio and move on with the FCC projects.

**Thoughts:** I need to prioritise coding more - we're busy in the evenings and it's hard to find time some nights!

### Day 13: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did some more work on my Portfolio and learned about forms and lists/navigations with CSS on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** I'm having a bit of a nightmare with the spacing on my Portfolio. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually so I'm continuing to put content and CSS in, but I've got no clue what's going on! I could doctor the spacing to make it look better but I'm going to wait until I actually know the best practice way to do it - I don't want to end up with a fudged bit of work.

### Day 12: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A bit of Javascript on Codewars, and starting to build my own reference sheet using the Best Practice solutions, to build on what I can find on the w3schools ref sheets.

**Thoughts:** Reference sheets are great but sometimes you need to nut out a problem and then see the "best" solution to really learn something - CodeWars is really teaching me good things in this way.

### Day 11: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A little bit of troubleshooting on my Portfolio and some CSS with Udemy. I also re-signed up with IFTTT because I wanted to build a soil sensor project and wanted to check if they had any cool APIs available (I remember using some cool Twitter ones from there a few years ago) and I found out that they've changed tack and are aiming for customers, not developers now -that was a bit disappointing.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes, if you're not focussed, you've just gotta fish around for something that'll take your fancy - occasionally I can stay working for hours but sometimes (like tonight) my eyes are glazing over!!

### Day 10: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just a little bit of CodeWars today - I'm unwell but spent a bit of time trying to troubleshoot while loops and arrays.

**Thoughts:** This gets tricky when I hit roadblocks and I'm not sure how to solve the problem, but I think that's the beauty of it and that's how I'll learn. I'm using the W3Schools reference sheets and they don't always have the functions needed for the solutions (or maybe the examples/explanations) so I may need to find another resource.

### Day 9: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I joined CodeWars and spent a few hours trying to work through some Kata - it's hard going at the moment but a great challenge!

**Thoughts:** I can get on board with the competitive and problem-solving nature of CodeWars, and I really like seeing the other solutions afterwards - they're always far more elegant than mine and I can learn from others' experience like that without feeling like I'm stealing their stuff!

### Day 8: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I made a decent start on my Portfolio page (FCC project). There are a few niggles with it (footer showing halfway up the page, images not properly aligned etc) but it's a really good framework to keep going with and I'm optimistic this time. 

**Thoughts:** It was much more successful than my last attempt and I can figure things out quickly by googling exactly what I need rather than having to go an do a tutorial on something before being able to use it in the project. I was tearing my hair out last time I did this and gave up, but this one was enjoyable to do - my skill level (and comfort level) has obviously increased a bit over this last week to allow me to do this. Onwards and upwards!

### Day 7: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did a mini-project to practice my CSS. Getting the image background in there drove me a bit crazy but I got it to work eventually!

**Thoughts:** I changed up my daily routine - came home and went straight to the study (instead of the couch with chippies and beer). It's served me well and hopefully I can keep it up because I've spent two hours coding today without feeling like my day's interrupted at all.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Further learning about linking, tagging, and some answers to long-standing questions about file management when coding from scratch.

**Thoughts:** I've now purchased an external monitor which has made it much easier to reference material while coding or studying code - I can follow along with the sessions in realtime or have reference material up on another screen - this is going to be a gamechanger. Also, having an office space I really don't want to leave (seriously it's super cool) is going to make me code more. Removing barriers is the best way for me to work.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did some further study with the Udemy course, following alongside with Notepad++. There was some new stuff with tables which was pretty cool and their resources are great - I'm saving them all for future reference.

**Thoughts:** I think I've got to get a few more of these study sessions under my belt before I go back to the FCC projects - I learn by doing but at the moment I don't have enough to work with so have to expand my knowledgebase. I have a dedicated study area now which is motivating me to spend more time studying and coding.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did some further study with the Udemy course, and then installed Github Desktop to try and learn a sustainable way of working on projects.

**Thoughts:** I had a quick browse on the available courses on Udemy and got excited by the possibilities of what there is to learn - I need to dedicate more time.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I didn't have any internet so did a coding from scratch exercise to see what I could remember without any referencing materials. It'll be good to recreate this exercise in 3 months and compare.

**Thoughts:** The best way to learn is to figure it out myself - getting the answer easily by looking it up when I'm stuck doesn't cement it for next time.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've started the Udemy course - The Complete Web Developer Masterclass. I've set up Notepad++ and started using Emmet. Abbreviations really appeal to me and I can see them being something I'll use a lot once I get the hang of it - I'm always building macros and shortcuts for my work so coding abbreviations will be handy.

**Thoughts:** Following courses is definitely a bit of a comfort zone for now - I might go 50/50 with following courses (Udemy and FCC) and Project work, as I can see the benefit of both, and the Udemy course has lots of exciting things further down the line like PHP and MySQL which I can use in day-to-day work. A better study environment will help, including a mouse and external monitor (working on it!) and I've also had support from work should I choose to study through the University for qualifications, so that's something to aim for - I'd like to get a bit more confidence before committing to that, and I'd like to know enough about what I enjoy to choose a specialty - this will come with experience.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started my Portfolio page (second FCC project in the training map). I've gone through a couple of other examples to look at the code they've used and see where to start.

**Thoughts:** It's been a couple of months since I touched the coding and oh gosh - this is harder than I thought. I think the hard part is starting - I know what to do when I've got code and I'm trying to troubleshoot or improve it, but writing it from scratch is far harder. I'm looking at other resources but typing whatever I take myself, as copy/paste won't help me learn. Perseverance is key - and that's why I stopped for so long - this project has definitely been a roadblock in the past. 100daysofcode will hopefully help me build a ladder over that!

### Day 0: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Preparing for my 100 days! Learned more about GitHub including basics like how to fork repositories. Getting reinvolved in the Code Camp forums and finding resources. Also spent some time learning how to customise Powershell.

**Thoughts:** This 100 days of code will be a good way to get momentum back - I enjoy learning but struggle to keep going when life gets busy. My 'profile project' from a couple of months ago (linked below) shows how easily I give up.
